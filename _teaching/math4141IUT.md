This is a 4 credit course intended for freshman students persuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. The goal of this course is to build a solid foundation in differecial canculus, 2D and 3D geometry for engineering studetns. My goal as the instructor was to present course contects in an intuitive manner and to connect the materials taught with various applications in the field of Computer Science.
