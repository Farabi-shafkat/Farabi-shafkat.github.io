This coruse is aimed at teaching freshman undergraduate students the basics of Computer Programming using Python. Over the course of the semester, the course covers python datatypes, loops, lists, dictionaries, and classes. As a graduate teaching assistant, my responsibilities consisted of  holding lab recitations, checking programming assignments, and holding office hours to help the students.
