</p>
ACM-ICPC is a prestigious competition where participant solve difficult problems using their algorithmic knowledge and programming skills. Every year, a preliminary contest is held in each region, and well performing teams are chosen to
compete in a regional contest. Top 3 best performing teacms from the regionals are sent to participate in the world finals. My team participated in the premiliminaries and qualified to participate in the regional contests for 3 consecutivbe years(2017, 2018 and 2019).

    <h1 >Completed Deep Learning Specialisation in Coursera</h1>
  </div>
  <img src='/images/COURSERA.png'style="width:100%">
</p>
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, algorithms based on the structure and functioning of the human brain, 
learn from large amounts of data to create patterns for decision-making. Neural networks with various (deep) layers enable 
learning through performing tasks repeatedly and tweaking them a little to improve the outcome. </br>

This specialisation is design and conducted by Andew NG, an industry and academic expert in Deep learning. The courses contain necessary theorerical background as well as hands on experiance using python, tensorflow and keras.
</p>
The specialisation has 5 courses:
<ol>
  <li>Neural Networks and Deep Learning</li>
  <li>Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization</li>
  <li>Structuring Machine Learning Projects</li>
  <li>Convolutional Neural Networks</li>
  <li>Sequence Models</li>
</ol>
