Hello! I am a PhD student at George Mason University since Fall, 2022. I am also working as a graduate teaching assistant in the Computer Science department. My reaserch focus is in the intersection of Computer Vision and Natural Langauge Processing. Currently, I am working on sarcasm detection in social media from multimodal inputs. 

Previously, I worked as a lecturer at my alma-mater Islamic University of Technology. I have a BSc in Computer Scinece and Engineering with honours with first class from the same institution. 

I love brainstorming to come up with solutions to complex problems and implementing them using programming languages. During my time as a student, I had participated in numerous ACM-ICPC style programming contests. I also  trained sophomore and junior year studnets in IUT for competative programming.
